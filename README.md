# project-pomodoro


The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. For this project, you will implement a simplified version of Cirillo's original Pomodoro technique.

Below is where you can PAUSE the Focusing Duration and could be started up without affecting the countdown

Below is an exmple where Break Duration starts as soon as Focusing Duration finishes, and Break Duration is also has a PAUSE  function. It will play sound after every countdown finishes.
